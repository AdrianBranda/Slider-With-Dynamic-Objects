# Slider-With-Dynamic-Objects
This repository contains the source code for a dynamic content slider with an infinite scrolling effect and an interactive description. The slider allows users to navigate through a series of elements (generic examples like "Object 1," "Object 2," etc., but easily customizable) and displays a detailed description of the currently centered element.
